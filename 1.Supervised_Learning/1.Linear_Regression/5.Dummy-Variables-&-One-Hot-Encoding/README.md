# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to handle categorical variables in a dataset using two popular techniques: **Dummy Variables** and **One-Hot Encoding**. It covers the end-to-end process of preparing the data, encoding categorical variables, and fitting a linear regression model to predict house prices based on area and location. The project showcases both manual creation of dummy variables using pandas and the use of scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder`.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project (`homeprices.csv`) contains information on house prices based on the area and the town where the house is located. The key columns in the dataset include:

- **town**: The location of the house (categorical variable).
- **area**: The area of the house in square feet.
- **price**: The price of the house (target variable).

## Handling Categorical Variables

### 1. Dummy Variables with Pandas

- **Objective**: Convert the categorical `town` column into numerical values suitable for machine learning models.
- **Method**: 
  - Use pandas' `get_dummies()` function to create dummy variables for each category in the `town` column.
  - After generating the dummy variables, the original `town` column is dropped from the dataset to avoid multicollinearity.
  - One of the dummy variables is also dropped to prevent the "dummy variable trap," where one dummy variable is a perfect predictor of the others.

### 2. One-Hot Encoding with Scikit-Learn

- **Objective**: Achieve the same result as with dummy variables, but using scikit-learn's `OneHotEncoder` for integration within a machine learning pipeline.
- **Method**: 
  - `LabelEncoder` is first used to convert the categorical `town` names into numerical labels.
  - `OneHotEncoder` is then applied through a `ColumnTransformer` to generate the one-hot encoded columns.
  - The first column generated by `OneHotEncoder` is removed to avoid the dummy variable trap.

## Model Training and Prediction

### 1. Linear Regression with Dummy Variables

- The model is trained using the dataset with manually created dummy variables.
- The model's prediction performance is evaluated using `model.score()`, which gives the coefficient of determination (RÂ² score).

### 2. Linear Regression with One-Hot Encoding

- The same linear regression model is trained using the one-hot encoded data.
- Predictions are made with the trained model to test its performance.
