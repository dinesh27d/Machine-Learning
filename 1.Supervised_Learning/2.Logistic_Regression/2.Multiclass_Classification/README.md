# Multiclass Classification Using Logistic Regression

## Introduction to Multiclass Classification
Multiclass classification is a type of classification where the goal is to predict one of three or more possible classes. Unlike binary classification, which deals with two possible outcomes, multiclass classification involves assigning an input to one of multiple classes. A common example is handwritten digit recognition, where the task is to classify an image of a digit (0-9) into its corresponding numeric class.

## Overview of the Workflow

1. **Loading and Exploring the Dataset:**
   - The dataset used in this project contains images of handwritten digits. Each image is represented in grayscale, and the corresponding labels indicate the digit the image represents. This data is loaded into the workspace for further processing.

2. **Visualizing the Data:**
   - A sample digit image is visualized to better understand the dataset. The image is displayed in grayscale to clearly show the structure of the digit, helping in visualizing what the model will be trained on.

3. **Splitting the Data:**
   - The dataset is split into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, while the testing set is reserved to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

4. **Training the Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Logistic regression, traditionally a binary classifier, is adapted to handle multiclass classification through techniques like one-vs-rest (OvR). The model is trained on the digit data to learn the patterns that correspond to each digit class.

5. **Evaluating the Model:**
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set. The accuracy score is calculated to determine how well the model can predict the correct digit for each test image.

6. **Making Predictions:**
   - The trained model is used to predict the digit for specific test images. Predictions are made for individual images as well as a small set of images, and the results are compared to the actual labels to assess accuracy.

7. **Confusion Matrix:**
   - A confusion matrix is generated to provide a detailed analysis of the model’s performance. This matrix shows how often the model correctly predicts each digit and where it makes mistakes. It is a useful tool for identifying specific areas where the model may need improvement.

8. **Visualizing the Confusion Matrix:**
   - To enhance interpretability, the confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap. The heatmap highlights correct predictions (along the diagonal) and errors (off the diagonal), making it easier to spot patterns in the model’s performance and understand which digits are often confused with one another.

This workflow outlines the process of training and evaluating a logistic regression model for multiclass classification, using handwritten digit data as an example.
