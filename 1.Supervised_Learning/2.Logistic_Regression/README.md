# Logistic Regression

## Introduction
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for analyzing datasets in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is typically a binary variable, meaning it has two possible values, such as 0 and 1, true and false, or yes and no. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous output, logistic regression predicts the probability of a binary outcome.

## Key Concepts
- **Binary Classification**: Logistic regression is primarily used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to categorize observations into one of two classes.
- **Sigmoid Function**: The model uses the sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1. These probabilities can then be thresholded to make binary decisions.
- **Odds and Log-Odds**: Logistic regression models the relationship between the features and the log-odds of the outcome, making it interpretable in terms of odds ratios.

## Applications
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting whether a patient has a disease (e.g., diabetes or heart disease) based on diagnostic tests.
- **Marketing**: Determining whether a customer will purchase a product based on their demographic information and past behavior.
- **Credit Scoring**: Assessing the likelihood that a loan applicant will default on a loan based on their financial history.

Logistic regression is a widely used method for classification due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in many practical scenarios.
