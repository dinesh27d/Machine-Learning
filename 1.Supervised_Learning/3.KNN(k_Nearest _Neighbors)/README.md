# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Overview

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful, supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks. The algorithm classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. It works by finding the 'k' nearest neighbors to the given data point in a feature space and assigning the class label that is most common among them.

In this tutorial, we utilize the KNN algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, using the well-known Iris dataset.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

These features are used to predict the class of the flower, which could be one of the following:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preparation

The Iris dataset is loaded and explored. The features (`sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, `petal width`) are organized into a DataFrame, and the target variable (flower species) is labeled with integer values.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A basic EDA is performed to visualize the data, particularly to understand how the features relate to each other across different classes. Scatter plots are generated to compare:
- Sepal length vs. Sepal width for Setosa and Versicolor species.
- Petal length vs. Petal width for Setosa and Versicolor species.

These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and separability of the classes based on the features.

### 3. Train-Test Split

The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the KNN model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. An 80-20 split is used, meaning 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is reserved for testing.

### 4. Model Training

A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is created with `k=10` neighbors. The model is trained using the training dataset, learning the relationship between the feature values and their corresponding class labels.

### 5. Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set. The accuracy score, which measures the percentage of correct predictions, is calculated. Additionally, predictions for individual data points are made to illustrate how the trained model works.

### 6. Confusion Matrix and Classification Report

A confusion matrix is plotted to provide a visual representation of the model's performance. The matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. 

Furthermore, a classification report is generated to provide detailed metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These metrics offer insights into how well the model distinguishes between the different classes in the dataset.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset. The model achieves high accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of KNN for simple classification tasks. The steps outlined here can be applied to other datasets and classification problems, making KNN a versatile tool in the machine learning toolkit.
