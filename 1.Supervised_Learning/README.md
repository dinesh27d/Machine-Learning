# Supervised Learning

## Introduction
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled dataset. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to the correct output labels. During training, the model makes predictions on the data and adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels. This type of learning is called "supervised" because the learning process is guided by the known outcomes.

## Key Concepts
- **Labeled Data**: In supervised learning, each example in the training dataset comes with an associated label or outcome. The model learns by comparing its predictions to these labels and adjusting accordingly.
- **Training and Testing**: The dataset is typically split into two parts: a training set used to teach the model, and a testing set used to evaluate its performance. The model's ability to generalize to new data is assessed using the test set.
- **Common Algorithms**: Some common algorithms used in supervised learning include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited for different types of problems.

## Applications
- **Email Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or not based on features such as the subject line, sender information, and email content.
- **Image Classification**: Assigning labels to images, such as identifying whether a picture contains a cat or a dog.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting whether a patient has a certain disease based on medical records and test results.

Supervised learning is a powerful approach for building predictive models when labeled data is available, making it a cornerstone of machine learning applications in various fields.
