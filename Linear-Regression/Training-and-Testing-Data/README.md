# Linear Regression Model for Car Price Prediction

This document provides an overview of how a linear regression model is trained and tested to predict car selling prices based on mileage and age.

## Overview

The goal is to build a linear regression model that can predict the selling price of a car using two features: mileage and age. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the process:

### 1. Loading the Dataset

The first step involves loading the dataset from a CSV file named `carprices.csv`. This dataset contains information about car prices along with their mileage and age. By examining the first few rows of the dataset, we gain an understanding of its structure and the type of data it contains.

### 2. Visualizing Relationships

To understand how mileage and age affect the selling price, scatter plots are created. These plots help visualize the relationship between:
- Car mileage and its selling price
- Car age and its selling price

Visualizing these relationships provides insight into how changes in mileage and age may influence the car's selling price.

### 3. Preparing the Data

In this step, the dataset is prepared for modeling. The features used for prediction are:
- **Mileage:** The distance the car has traveled.
- **Age (years):** The age of the car in years.

The target variable is:
- **Selling Price:** The price at which the car is sold.

### 4. Splitting the Data

The data is divided into two sets:
- **Training Set:** Used to train the model.
- **Testing Set:** Used to evaluate the model’s performance.

Typically, 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. This split allows us to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

### 5. Training the Model

A linear regression model is then trained using the training data. During this phase, the model learns the relationship between the features (mileage and age) and the target variable (selling price). 

### 6. Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on the test data. These predictions estimate the selling prices based on the mileage and age of the cars in the test set.

### 7. Evaluating the Model

The performance of the model is assessed using the R² score. The R² score indicates how well the predicted prices match the actual selling prices. A higher R² score suggests a better fit between the model’s predictions and the actual data.

## Summary

- **Data Visualization:** Helps understand the relationship between features and the target variable.
- **Data Splitting:** Ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data.
- **Model Training:** Involves learning the relationship between features and the target variable.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures the accuracy of the predictions using the R² score.
